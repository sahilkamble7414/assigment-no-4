    "#que 1)What are the five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "1)CLASS:-The class can be defined as a collection of objects. It is a logical entity that has some specific attributes and methods\n",
    "2)OBJECT:-the object is an variable that cantain data & function that can use to manipulate tha data.\n",
    "3)Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the concept of bundling the attributes and methods that operate on the data into a single class.\n",
    "4)Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism where a class (child class) can inherit attributes and methods from parent class. This promotes code reuse and helps to create a hierarchy of classes.\n",
    "5)Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables methods to be used in different ways, typically through method overloading and method overriding .\n"
